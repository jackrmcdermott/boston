        <p>
        Don’t you love this city by the open sea,</br>
        This city that mothered the Home of the Free?</br>
        Don’t you love this city with its wrinkled brow,</br>
        And its streets laid out by the wandering cow?</br>
        </p>

        <p>
        Don't you love this city with its spires and domes,</br>
        With its gilded crosses and its Godly homes?</br>
        Don't you love this city with its customs old,</br>
        And its wisdom to know the dross from the gold?</br>
        </p>

        <p>
        Don’t you love this city and its Bunker Hill,</br>
        And its age-old shrines of glorious thrill?</br>
        Don’t you love this city, the old and the new,</br>
        With its grip on the things that are lasting and true?</br>
        </p>

        <p>
        Don’t you love this city with its air of grace,</br>
        Its delight with beauty and disgust with the base?</br>
        Don’t you love this city when the shadows fall,</br>
        And the birds wing home to the Common mall?</br>
        </p>

        <p>
        Don't you love this city when the dawning sun,</br>
        Bursts  from the sea where the codfish run?</br>
        Don't you love this city when the wind's in the east?</br>
        And the smell of the deep is the free man's feast?</br>
        </p>

        <p>
        Don't you love this city with its gales and snow,</br>
        With its summer warmth and its autumn glow?</br>
        Don't you love this city when its trees so bare,</br>
        Are laced in blossoms fragrant and fair?</br>
        </p>

        <p>
        Don't you love this city where knowledge waits,</br>
        For those who walk through its library gates?</br>
        Don't you love this city and the things we prize,</br>
        The preacher dauntless and the scholar wise?</br>
        </p>

        <p>
        Don't you love this city where art is long,</br>
        With its principles true and its faith so strong?</br>
        Don't you love this city where the fleeting years,</br> 
        Have left a trail that heartens and cheers?</br>
        </p>

        <p>
        Don't you love this city where the color ban,</br>
        Has long since vanished like the school rattan?</br>
        Don't you love this city with its mingled strains,</br>
        Where men are equal and where harmony reigns?</br>
        </p>

        <p>
        Don't you love this city where roots go deep,</br>
        In the soil of the land where the martyrs sleep?</br>
        Don't you love this city born of struggle and strife,</br>
        Where the false is interred and truth given life?</br>
        </p>

        <p>
        Don’t you love this city and its grand old name,</br>
        That swells the heart as we think of its fame?</br>
        Don’t you love this city wherever you roam,</br>
        And who is not proud to call it home?</br>
        </p>

        <p>
        For Boston is Boston and forever she’ll stand,</br>
        A tower of truth in a truth-loving land.</br>
        Forever she’ll stand for all that is just,</br>
        ‘Til the world is no more and all is dust.</br>
        </p>

        <p>
        So love old Boston from her head to her toes,</br>
        Be one of her gallants, be one of her beaux.</br>
        Be one who will shout in tones firm and clear,</br>
        She’s the most Gracious Damsel in the whole hemisphere.</br>
        </p>
